# Examples
## Extracting Files From a Remote Webiste
Here I use ```wget``` to make a request to stackoverflow then I forward the body text to ```ds``` . The ```-F``` option will list all files found. ```--clean``` is used to remove any extra text that might have been returned (such as extra html). Then the result of is sent to ```uniq``` which removes any non unique files found. Ig you wanted you can remove the warning message at the top 'Reading standard input..' by using -S.
```
$ wget -qO - https://www.stackoverflow.com | ds -F --clean | uniq
```

## Extracting Mac Addresses From an Output File
Here I am pulling all mac addresses found in [autodeauth's](https://github.com/Drew-Alleman/autodeauth) log file using the ```-m``` query. The ```--hide``` option will hide the identifer string infront of the results. In this case 'mac_address: ' is hidden from the output. The ```-T``` option is used to check the same line multiple times for matches. Normallly when a match is found the tool moves on to the next line rather then checking again. 
```
$ ./ds -m -T --hide -f /var/log/autodeauth/log     
2023-02-26 00:28:19 - Sending 500 deauth frames to network: BC:2E:48:E5:DE:FF -- PrivateNetwork
2023-02-26 00:35:22 - Sending 500 deauth frames to network: 90:58:51:1C:C9:E1 -- TestNet
```

## Reading all files in a directory
You can use the ```--directory``` option to read all files in the specified directory recursively. The ```-D``` option is used to display the filename where the match was found.
```
$ ds --directory test_dir/ -D
```

## CSV Output
To output your results to a CSV file, use the ```-o``` option followed by the name of the file you want to save your data to. The ```-D``` and ```-X``` are supported. The format is: ```ds -o <FILENAME>.csv``` (.csv is needed). 
```
 $ wget -qO - https://www.stackoverflow.com | ds -o output.csv -C
```

# Speed Tests
When no specific query is provided, ```ds``` will search through all possible types of data, which is <b>SIGNIFICANTLY</b> slower than using individual queries. The slowest query is ```--files```. Its also slightly faster to use ```cat``` to pipe the data to ```ds```. 

Below is the elapsed time when processing a 5GB test file generated by [ds-test](https://github.com/Drew-Alleman/ds-test). Each test was ran 3 times and the average time was recorded.

### Computer Specs 
```
Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10400F CPU @ 2.90GHz, 2904 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)
Ram         12.0 GB (11.9 GB usable)
```

## Searching all data types

Command         | Speed         
----------------|----------------
`cat test.txt \| ds -t` | 00h:02m:04s |
`ds -t -f test.txt` | 00h:02m:05s
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -o output.txt` | 00h:02m:06s

## Using specific queries

Command         | Speed          | Query Count
----------------|----------------|----------------
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -6` | 00h:00m:12s | 1
`cat test.txt \| ds -t -i -m` | 00h:00m:22 | 2
`cat test.txt \| ds -tF6c` | 00h:00m:32s | 3

# Recent Updates
## 5/25/2023 | 1.1.4
Added the ```--line``` or ```-l``` option which when enabled will show the line number the content was found on in the specified file/stream. 
## 5/24/2023 | 1.1.3
Added a few custom error messages and the ```--ignore``` option which is used to ignore said messages that might be printed to the screen.
## 4/25/2023 | 1.1.2
This update includes the addition of the dependency "walkdir". The directory option is used to process all files found in the specified directory you can still use the -D or --display option to show the file where the match was located.
## 4/25/2023 | 1.1.1
Include only lines that match the specified regex. (e.g: ```--filter ^error``` will only include lines that start with the word 'error')
### 4/25/2023 | (Windows Installer Update)
After reinstalling DataSurgeon, the installation path "C:/ds/" was appended to the end of the user's environmental variable path, even if it was already installed. (Fixed)
